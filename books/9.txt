Wrapt in Olivia's veil, Ellena descended to the music-room, and mingled
with the nuns, who were assembled within the grate. Among the monks
and pilgrims without it, were some strangers in the usual dress of the
country, but she did not perceive any person who resembled Vivaldi;
and she considered, that, if he were present, he would not venture to
discover himself, while her nun's veil concealed her as effectually
from him as from the lady Abbess. It would be necessary, therefore,
to seek an opportunity of withdrawing it for a moment at the grate, an
expedient, which must certainly expose her to the notice of strangers.

On the entrance of the lady Abbess, Ellena's fear of observation
rendered her insensible to every other consideration; she fancied, that
the eyes of the Superior were particularly directed upon herself. The
veil seemed an insufficient protection from their penetrating glances,
and she almost sunk with the terror of instant discovery.
