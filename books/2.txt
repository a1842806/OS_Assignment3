THE POOR COUNT’S CHRISTMAS


Very many years ago there lived a noble Count, who was one of the
kindest and best-hearted men in the world. Every day in the year he
gave to the poor and helped the friendless, but it was at the merry
Christmas-time that his goodness shone brightest. He had even vowed a
vow that, as far as he was able to make them so, every child he knew
should be happy Christmas-day.

Early every Christmas morning each boy and girl in the neighborhood who
was old enough, and not too old, came to the castle of the Count Cormo,
and there the Count and Countess welcomed them all, rich or poor, and
through the whole day there were games, and festive merry-making, and
good things to eat, and fun of every kind, and besides all this, there
was a grand Christmas-tree, with a present on it for each of the eager,
happy youngsters who stood around it.
